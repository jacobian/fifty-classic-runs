About the difficulty ratings

Given as "50k" / "50M" / "100M".

These aren't distances, per se, but are a difficulty relative to an ultra race distance -- e.g., if you can complete a moderately difficult race of that distance, you should be fit enough to do this run. You'll likely be slower -- self-support, navigatgion, etc -- but should be able to hack it.

Assume these are moderately difficult mountain races: so, mostly trail (single or doubletrack), runnable, maybe with some mildly technical sections, and total elevation gain around 100-150 feet per mile (e.g: 4,000' in a 50k, 6,000' 50M, 10,000' 100M).

Additionally, a difficulty rating might have a "+" or a "-", given that it's a bit more or less difficult than a race of that given distance.

For example:

- [Rim-To-Rim-To-Rim]({{< ref "runs/r2r2r.md" >}}) is is "only" 42 miles, but has over 10k of total climb, and deals with the heat of the canyon. It's rated "50M+" -- runners who can complete a 50 mile mountain race could consider R2R2R, but should think twice and plan carefully as it'll be significantly harder.
- The [Skyline to the Sea trail]({{< ref "runs/skyline-to-the-sea.md" >}}) 25 miles, mostly downhill, on very smooth trail. It's rated "50k-" -- this route should be well within the grasp of a runner who's completed a 50K or two.
