Inspired by 50 Classic Climbs

Adventure runs:

- individual (not a race)
- doable self-supported
- mostly in the mountains
- mostly on trail (some scrabbling)

"Classic routes" - need defined

- mix of established classic routes (r2r2r) and lesser-known-but-should-be-classic
- aesthetically pleasing (following particular lines or features)
- point to point or loops
- no repeats (X summits etc)
- mostly ultra-distance
