    <p>About the difficulty ratings</p>
<p>Given as &ldquo;50k&rdquo; / &ldquo;50M&rdquo; / &ldquo;100M&rdquo;.</p>
<p>These aren't distances, per se, but are a difficulty relative to an ultra race distance &ndash; e.g., if you can complete a moderately difficult race of that distance, you should be fit enough to do this run. You'll likely be slower &ndash; self-support, navigatgion, etc &ndash; but should be able to hack it.</p>
<p>Assume these are moderately difficult mountain races: so, mostly trail (single or doubletrack), runnable, maybe with some mildly technical sections, and total elevation gain around 100-150 feet per mile (e.g: 4,000&rsquo; in a 50k, 6,000&rsquo; 50M, 10,000&rsquo; 100M).</p>
<p>Additionally, a difficulty rating might have a &ldquo;+&rdquo; or a &ldquo;-&quot;, given that it's a bit more or less difficult than a race of that given distance.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://example.org/grand-canyon-rim-to-rim-to-rim/">Rim-To-Rim-To-Rim</a> is is &ldquo;only&rdquo; 42 miles, but has over 10k of total climb, and deals with the heat of the canyon. It's rated &ldquo;50M+&rdquo; &ndash; runners who can complete a 50 mile mountain race could consider R2R2R, but should think twice and plan carefully as it'll be significantly harder.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://example.org/skyline-to-the-sea/">Skyline to the Sea trail</a> 25 miles, mostly downhill, on very smooth trail. It's rated &ldquo;50k-&rdquo; &ndash; this route should be well within the grasp of a runner who's completed a 50K or two.</li>
</ul>
